About Dataset
Credit scoring is a critical banking task. The standard approach is to build classical ML models, such as logistic regression and gradient binning, on tabular data, including using aggregations from some sequential data, such as transactional customer histories. An alternative approach is to use sequential data "as is" by feeding it to the input of a recurrent neural network.
